//! Connection pooling infrastructure for DNS upstreams
//!
//! Provides high-performance connection management with different pooling
//! strategies:
//!
//! # Pool Types
//!
//! ## Pipeline Pool (`pipeline.rs`)
//! - Supports multiple concurrent requests per connection
//! - Ideal for TCP/TLS/QUIC/DoH where connections can handle parallel queries
//! - Automatic scaling based on load (min_size to max_size)
//! - Configurable max load per connection to prevent overloading
//!
//! ## Reuse Pool (`reuse.rs`)
//! - One request per connection at a time
//! - Connections are borrowed and returned to pool
//! - Ideal for UDP or when pipelining is disabled
//! - Automatic idle connection cleanup
//!
//! # Connection Types
//! - `udp_conn`: UDP connections with automatic TCP fallback
//! - `tcp_conn`: Plain TCP and DoT (DNS over TLS) connections
//! - `quic_conn`: DoQ (DNS over QUIC) connections
//! - `h2_conn`: DoH over HTTP/2 connections
//! - `h3_conn`: DoH over HTTP/3 connections
//!
//! # Performance Features
//! - Lock-free connection selection with atomic operations
//! - Background maintenance tasks for idle connection cleanup
//! - Request/response matching via lock-free request map
//! - Zero-copy message passing where possible
//! - Connection reuse to amortize handshake costs
